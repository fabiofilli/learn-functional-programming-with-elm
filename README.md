# Learn Functional Programming with Elm

## About
I want to introduce functional programming to young hackers with the functional language Elm.

My goal is to write two guides. The first guide covers functional programming concepts and the language Elm. The second guide is an extension that includes the use of web technologies. Elm comes with web technologies (Html, CSS, SVG, …) therefore it's harder to start with as newbie to programming, especially if you don’t know how the web works.

The next step would be to create an interactive Elm web app to help young hackers kickstart their knowledge on Functional Programming with Elm! It's always nice to have another open source Elm app showcase to learn from.
